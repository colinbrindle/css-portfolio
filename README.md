# Unit 2 Advanced CSS: Project Portfolio Homework

### Project Description
The aim of this project was to utilize the skills we have learned so far in our coding boot camp to build a portfolio website. This project tested HTML and CSS concepts including flexbox, media queries, class/element selectors, etc.

We have learned a lot of content very quickly, so this project was quite challenging for me. That said, **I do not accept defeat!** Coding -- and learning to code -- is an iterative process, and I will surely revisit this site and improve it as I develop my understanding of HTML, CSS, (and perhaps JavaScript). 

Areas that I have had the most difficulty with and will work to fix:
- **Header Alignment:** The 'about me', 'my work', and 'contact' headers are not properly aligned to one another.
- **Portfolio Grid:** The portfolio grid is very manually set at the moment (i.e., hard coded dimension values) and therefore not dynamic.
    - **Portfolio Links:** Links in the portfolio grid are only in the 
    h3 tag, I would like the entire grid cell to link to content in the future.
    - **Portfolio Animations:** I would also like to add hover over animations to the grid cells.
- **Media Queries:** Media queries need to be implemented to restructure the site for smaller screens and mobile devices. I have held off on implementing this for now due to difficulties with header alignment and the portfolio grid.
